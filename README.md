## DjangoVerse


The [DjangoVerse](http://www.londondjangocollective.com/djangoverse) is a 3D graph of players in the Gypsy Jazz scene around the world. The different colours correspond to different countries. Two players are linked if they have gigged together. Anyone can [add players](http://www.londondjangocollective.com/api/forms/player/add) or [edit existing players](http://www.londondjangocollective.com/api/forms/player/list).
